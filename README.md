# Zomato-case-study
The Zomato case study models a food delivery system using tables: users store customer data, restaurant holds partner info, menu links restaurants to food items, order tracks purchases, order_details breaks down items, and delivery_partner manages delivery. This enables full-cycle order tracking.
